📦 Author Copy: How & When You Get Your Free Book (only applicable for authors in India)

                                          * You’ll receive a coupon code for our online bookstore after publication.

                                          * You can use this coupon to order your paperback copy at zero cost.

                                          * The coupon is valid only for authors residing in India.

🚚 Shipping Details:
                                             * In most cases, shipping is free.

                                             * However, in rare scenarios (locations with limited courier access), minimal shipping charges may apply.

                                             * Authors outside India are not eligible for a free author copy at this time.

This system allows you to track your copy conveniently and order it at your preferred address and time.
________________


❌ Offline Store Availability
Your book will not be available in physical retail bookstores.

                                                * In Global Distribution or Bestseller Breakthrough Package, Ingram distribution is included, which means over 30,000+ stores and libraries will have access to your book, but the availability of your book in those stores and libraries depends on whether those stores or libraries order your book. BookLeaf Publishing cannot guarantee that.

📦 What Happens After Cover Design?
Once the cover is finalized, you’ll move to the Book Distribution section, where you enter “about the author” and “about the book” information.
⚠️ Note: Information entered here (about the author or about the book) will not auto-update your back cover. This is only for the ecommerce stores like BookLeaf’s bookstore and Amazon.
If you'd like the same details reflected on the back cover, you must manually edit them in the Cover Design section.

                                                                                                                                                                                    * The coupon allows you to order one free author copy via the BookLeaf online bookstore

📅 When Will I Receive My Author Copy Coupon Code?
                                                                                                                                                                                       * Please check the confirmation email (which says your book has been published) — it contains a link to submit your review. We kindly request you to complete the review, and once it’s done, you will receive the coupon code within 10 business days.

                                                                                                                                                                                       * Once your review is submitted, your coupon code will be emailed within 10 business days

This ensures we close the loop and gather author feedback while also enabling access to your copy.

🎁 Why Did I Receive a Coupon Code Instead of a Physical Author Copy?
Due to the volume of titles we publish and frequent courier issues, physical author copy deliveries have been challenging to manage at scale.
To ensure:
                                                                                                                                                                                          * A faster and more reliable delivery experience

                                                                                                                                                                                          * A better tracking experience for you

...we’ve shifted to issuing coupon codes redeemable at the BookLeaf Store.
You can order your book at your preferred time and address using this code — cutting down delays and increasing flexibility.
📌 For authors who chose Bestseller Breakthrough Package, the coupon code will not be sent, instead we will directly ship 5 copies to their address (applicable in India).

The author copy is free, but the delivery charge may still apply in the following cases:
                                                                                                                                                                                             * Your address is in a remote or non-standard courier zone

                                                                                                                                                                                             * There is no free courier service available for your pincode

In these cases, a minimal shipping charge may apply — we do not profit from this fee. It is solely to cover logistics.

💯 What Does “100% Royalty” Mean in the Bestseller Breakthrough Package?
When we say “100% royalty”, it means:
You receive 100% of the profit from each sale — after all mandatory costs are deducted.
Here’s what is deducted before calculating your royalty:
                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Printing and paper costs

                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Platform commissions (e.g., Amazon's cut)

                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Packaging and handling

                                                                                                                                                                                                      * GST and transaction fees

                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Discount structures and return buffers

📘 Example:
If your book is listed at ₹150:
                                                                                                                                                                                                         * Total deductions might be ₹80 (example)

                                                                                                                                                                                                         * Your royalty will be calculated on the ₹70 profit, not the ₹150 price

✅ This ensures you receive the entire profit, unlike standard publishing models where only a small fraction is shared.

❗ Why Is My Book Showing “Out of Stock” or “Unavailable” on Amazon?
This issue may appear occasionally due to Amazon’s internal system syncing delays. This is a common occurrence.
Here’s what you should know:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                     * Your book is still live and published in our system

                                                                                                                                                                                                                     * Amazon may temporarily show “Currently Unavailable” or “Out of Stock”

                                                                                                                                                                                                                     * This typically resolves within 24–48 hours

✅ What you should do:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Check the listing again after a few hours

                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * If the issue persists beyond 48 hours, raise a support ticket so we can escalate it

🟢 Why Isn’t My Book Marked as “Prime” on Amazon Yet?
As soon as your book is listed on Amazon.in, we submit a request for it to be made Prime eligible.
However:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                           * The decision and timeline is entirely controlled by Amazon

We are actively monitoring your listing and will follow up as needed. Thank you for your patience while Amazon finalizes the Prime eligibility.

🚚 I Have Amazon Prime — Why Am I Still Being Charged Delivery?
Even if you're a Prime member, Amazon sometimes applies shipping fees on:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                              * Print-on-demand products

                                                                                                                                                                                                                              * Books fulfilled by third-party sellers

Since BookLeaf books are POD (print-on-demand), Amazon handles the shipping fee directly.
📌 We do not control Amazon’s delivery charges and cannot remove them, even for Prime users.

❓ What Does “80% Royalty” Mean?
When we say “80% royalty,” it refers to 80% of the profit earned, not 80% of the book's listed price.
The book’s listed price includes:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     * Printing cost

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     * Platform fees (e.g., Amazon commission)

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     * GST and other taxes

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     * Handling and packaging

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     * Distribution & return costs

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     * Platform discounts (e.g., Amazon often takes 25–50% off MRP)
Example:
If your book is listed at ₹150 on Amazon:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * ₹40 may go toward printing

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * ₹45 may be deducted by Amazon (platform discount + fees + taxes)

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Remaining profit: ₹65

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * You’ll receive 80% of ₹65 = ₹52

💯 Understanding “100% Royalty” (For Bestseller Breakthrough Authors Only)
If you’ve purchased the Bestseller Breakthrough Package, you're eligible for 100% royalty.
This means:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           * You receive the entire profit (after deductions) from each sale.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           * You still don’t receive 100% of the listed price — platform costs and printing still apply.

Example:
If your book is listed at ₹150:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              * Printing + taxes + fees = ₹60

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              * Net profit = ₹90

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              * You’ll receive ₹90 as your royalty

This model ensures the entire profit margin goes to you.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            * Final copyright certificate is typically issued within 6–9 months
